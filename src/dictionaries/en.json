    "manifestDesc": "Our Manifesto outlines how we are building an online space in which content is generated and consumed in a radically different way. Our social impact goal is to foster empathy, knowledge and meaningful dialogue, towards prompting 'Eureka moments': individual revelations that transform the collective. Ultimately, we want to foster social and political transformation online and offline.",
    "manifestRow1Box1Title": "We create communities",
    "manifestRow1Box1Desc": "We believe that great revelations only occur within the collective. Likewise, reading books and watching films is all the more powerful when it becomes a collective activity, because it enhances their potential to connect us to the world and to others.",
    "manifestRow1Box2Title": "We consider that rules should be contextual",
    "manifestRow1Box2Desc": "To ensure that rules are relevant and culturally sensitive, each cycle has the ability to define its own guidelines (which must be generally aligned with our Manifesto).

    "manifestRow2Box1Desc": "Diverse representation is paramount to ensure individuals are more empathetic and can challenge dominant narratives (often western, male and white).

    "manifestRow2Box2Title": "We cultivate critical thinking",
    "manifestRow2Box2Desc": "No pitfalls of the ‘attention economy’ here. Our goal is to favor analytical thinking and debate, hoping it also has positive spillovers all over the networked-public sphere. Take this opportunity to lead by example and be constructive in your exchanges.",
    "manifestRow2Box3Title": "We fight misinformation",
    "manifestRow2Box3Desc": "Recent studies suggest that misinformation is often shared because we don’t pay sufficient attention about content. As a general rule of thumb, we ask you to always double check your facts and prioritize official and trustworthy sources of information. Resist to sensationalistic writings to avoid nurturing clickbait, and of course don’t engage deliberately in content manipulation.",
    "manifestRow3Box1Title": "We value time and slow content",
    "manifestRow3Box1Desc": "Unlike other incumbent social networks, our algorithms DO NOT reward immediacy or number of clicks. Take your time to read and watch books and films, to think and to write! We designed Eureka to support your process, not disturb it.",
    "manifestRow3Box2Title": "We value people, not data monetization",
    "manifestRow3Box2Desc": "Our priority is to have a social impact, not to generate profits. Eureka is a non-for-profit and non-data-extractivist organization. This means we do not monetize your data for profit and strive to sustain our platform without ads.",
