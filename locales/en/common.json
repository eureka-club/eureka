  "aboutText": "An Eureka is an individual revelation that can transform the collective. On the platform, it takes the form of a written reflection about a work or cycle, accompanied by a square photo/image of your choice. By sharing your Eureka with the community, you can potentially inspire change!",
  "whatisCycleHeading": "What is a cycle?",
  "whatisCycleText": "Cycles are spaces created for the curious and the experts to dive into a topic, together with a community. They are a selection of 2-5 books and/or films about a specific topic. Cycles are ‘active’ during a set range of dates, so you can read/watch along and discuss with the community on a rolling basis. After the cycle is over, you can still access the content and the discussion. Note: Cycles can be public (accessible to everyone), private (indexed, participation subject to approval by cycle creator) or secret (by invitation only).",
  "whatisPostHeading": "What is your Mediatheque?",
  "whatisPostText": "It is your personal mixed-media library. It gathers your Eurekas, the cycles you have created and participated in, as well as the books and films you have read/watched (if you rated it, you read/watched it). Any item you ‘Save’ will also go straight to your Mediatheque. Last but not least: it is also where you share (as much as you want) about yourself and keep a list of users you follow.",
